# SwitchGameUpdates
Small python program, using tkinter gui, which could be used to manage switch game updates.

**Currently broken as @Blawar's Repo is down, versions.txt and titledata.json, was originally pulled from his repo, on program launch**

Program allows you to input your current games and version number, and upon program start it would fetch the details about the latest version, and be able to show you which games had pending updates.
